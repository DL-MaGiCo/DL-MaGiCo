Hi, this is DL-MaGiCo.

We are a group of three students @ PoliTo: Maria, Giorgia, Corrado (the name is indeed the concatenation of our names first syllable!).

We created this repository to work on a group project for the class 'Machine Learning and Deep Learning'. 
Such project will focus on Visual Place Recognition (VPR), feel free to explore the folder if you are interested in knowing more about it.
